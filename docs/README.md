This is Que's Docs system: [http://queiot.co/docs](queiot.co/docs)
===

- Each `*.md` file in here is a documentation page that is hosted at
  `queiot.co/docs/*****` (notice, no file extension)
- Make sure to add new pages to `index.md` before pushing any new documentation
  to make finding documentation as easy as possible for users
