Que's IoT Controller
===
This app is an fancy [IoT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things) controller.
However, what makes this app different is it's easy to host yourself, and it is a relatively easy
to develop your own things. Every other platform that I've seen has a dashboard of some sort that
you can configure stuff, and most likely get nearly what you want. It works reasonably well, but
I, like many people, want to be able to control every aspect of each thing - this is the 'linux'
of internet of things controllers.
